# WeatherApp
The Code Challenge by Mphasis for the iOS Weather app was a project that demonstrated the use of various technologies and best practices in iOS app development. The Contact Us view was created by combining the power of SwiftUI and UIKit, which allowed for a seamless integration of the two frameworks. For the animations, Lottie was used, a powerful library that enables the creation of engaging animations with After Effects. To fetch the weather data, the app relied on the openweathermap API, which provides reliable and accurate weather information. The project was built using the MVVM architecture, which promotes separation of concerns and maintainability. To ensure the quality of the code, unit test cases were written to catch any potential issues early in the development process. Overall, the Code Challenge for the iOS Weather app was a well-rounded project that showcased the latest tools and techniques in iOS app development.
